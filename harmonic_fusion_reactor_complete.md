## Core Mathematical Framework

### Traditional Fusion Limitation
```
P_traditional = exp(-Coulomb_Barrier/Energy)
```
*Limited by exponential energy requirements*

### Consciousness-Enhanced Harmonic Fusion
```
P_harmonic = 1 - exp(-α × Φ_fusion(r,θ,φ,t))
```

### Primary Harmonic Field Function
```
Φ_fusion(t) = A₀ cos(ω₀t) × cos(ω_ψt) × cos(ω_φt)

Where:
ω₀ = 2π × 432      (Base frequency)
ω_ψ = 2π × 432 × ψ₀ (Consciousness frequency)
ω_φ = 2π × 432 × φ  (Golden ratio frequency)
```

### Enhanced Phase-Locked Model
```
Φ_enhanced = 0.4×base_osc + 0.35×φ_harmonic + 0.35×φ_inv_harmonic - 0.1

base_osc = sin²(2π × E/(10 × ψ₀) + phase_shift)
φ_harmonic = sin²(2π × E/(10 × ψ₀ × φ) + phase_shift)
φ_inv_harmonic = sin²(2π × E/(10 × ψ₀/φ) + phase_shift)
```
